### Machine Learning Pipeline

#### Model Selection Criteria
```python
# Pseudo-code for model selection
def select_best_model(product_data):
    models = {
        'prophet': ProphetModel(),
        'xgboost': XGBoostModel(), 
        'arima': ARIMAModel(),
        'neural': NeuralNetworkModel()
    }
    
    best_model = None
    best_score = 0
    
    for name, model in models.items():
        score = cross_validate(model, product_data)
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_model = model
    
    return best_model, best_score
```

#### Forecast Evaluation Metrics
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Primary accuracy metric
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Penalizes large errors
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Robust to outliers
- **Forecast Bias**: Systematic over/under-forecasting detection

### Optimization Algorithms

#### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
```
EOQ = √(2 × Annual Demand × Ordering Cost / Holding Cost)
```

#### Safety Stock Calculation
```
Safety Stock = Z-score × σ_demand × √(Lead Time)
```

#### Reorder Point Optimization
```
ROP = (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```
